upgrade:

   'Show Package Contents'.
2) Navigate to the directory 'Contents/Resources/Java' in the 
   application bundle.
3) Copy the multibit.wallet and multibit.info files to a safe place.
4) If you have any other wallet and info files in this directory,
   copy them to a safe place.
5) Install MultiBit as normal.
