MultiBit is currently experimental software.
Do not use it with large amounts of bitcoin.

Please note that we are still working on multiple wallet support.
To avoid any problems please make sure you wait for at least one 
block confirmation after a spend before switching wallets.   Thanks.




Configuration Options:

+ Connect to single node
If you want to connect to a single node set the following 
property in multibit.properties:
singleConnectionNode=<node to connect to>

The node can be specified as either a domain name (www.myNode.com) 
or an IP address.


+ Testnet
To use the testnet set the property "testOrProductionNetwork" 
in the file multibit.properties to be "test".
