MultiBit Configuration Options:

All these options are set in the main control file:
multibit.properties


+ Connect to specific peers
If you want to connect to specific peers set the following 
property:

peers=<comma separated list of peers to connect to>

The list of peers can be specified using domain names (www.myNode.com) 
or IP addresses. Example:

peers=173.242.119.177, 176.9.42.247, 217.79.19.226, 98.216.173.54

(The older property singleNodeConnection is still honoured but is
now deprecated. Use 'peers' instead).

Note: ONLY these peers will be used for connections.


+ Testnet / testnet3
To use the testnet set the property "testOrProductionNetwork" 
to be "test".

To use the testnet3 set the property "testOrProductionNetwork" 
to be "testnet3".
