MultiBit Configuration Options:

All these options are set in the main control file:
multibit.properties


+ Connect to single node
If you want to connect to a single node set the following 
property:
singleNodeConnection=<node to connect to>

The node can be specified as either a domain name (www.myNode.com) 
or an IP address e.g if your node was 12.34.56.78 you would put:

singleNodeConnection=12.34.56.78


+ Testnet
To use the testnet set the property "testOrProductionNetwork" 
to be "test".


+ UseCacheManager
To use the experimental caching of blocks in the 
<applicationDataDirectory/cache/block directory set:
useCacheManager = true.

This will take about 3GB of data (for 200,000 blocks).
How it works is that whenever a block is downloaded, it is stored
in the cache directory in a file [hash of block].block. To get
the whole blockchain cached locally you can do a 'Reset blockchain
and transactions' from a date before the genesis block, say sometime
in 2008.

Note: this technique I have put in simply for convenience (my
download bandwidth is capped). It is not the 'right' way to do
things. Matt Corrallo's work on having a server side bloom 
filter I expect will eliminate this cache.
