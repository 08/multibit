MultiBit Configuration Options:

All these options are set in the main control file:
multibit.properties


+ Connect to single node
If you want to connect to a single node set the following 
property:
singleNodeConnection=<node to connect to>

The node can be specified as either a domain name (www.myNode.com) 
or an IP address e.g if your node was 12.34.56.78 you would put:

singleNodeConnection=12.34.56.78


+ Testnet
To use the testnet set the property "testOrProductionNetwork" 
to be "test".


+ UseCacheManager
To use the experimental caching of blocks in the <applicationDataDirectory/cache/block directory set:
useCacheManager = true.

This will take about 3GB of data (for 200,000 blocks).
