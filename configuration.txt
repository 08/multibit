MultiBit configuration options
==============================

All these options are set in the main control file:
multibit.properties. Multibit looks in a few places for this file:

1. Current working directory when launched. This is for backwards compatibility and for running from a USB drive.

2. (Mac OS X only) Four directory levels up. This is for running from a USB drive, but outside the OSX .app directory.
 
3. The operating system's standard application data directory. 
   - Windows
     * `System.getenv("APPDATA")/MultiBit`
     * e.g. `C:/Documents and Settings/Administrator/Application Data/MultiBit`

   - Mac OS X
     * `System.getProperty("user.home")/Library/Application Support/MultiBit`
     * e.g. `/Users/jim/Library/Application Support/MultiBit`

   - Linux:
     * `System.getProperty("user.home")/MultiBit`
     * e.g. `/Users/jim/MultiBit`

Wherever this file is found, that directory is used as the application data directory for Multibit.

Show Delete Wallet
------------------
To enable the display in the File menu of the 'Delete Wallet' option, set the following property:
showDeleteWallet = true

When deleting a wallet, to avoid accidental deletion, MultiBit asks you:
"To confirm this action enter the name of the creator of Bitcoin"

The answer is:
satoshi nakamoto

Note that when a wallet is deleted the wallet data directory and all the wallet backups
are NOT deleted. You have to secure delete this directory manually (as long as you are sure you do not
need them). 


Connect to specific peers
-------------------------
If you want to connect to specific peers set the following 
property:

peers=<comma separated list of peers to connect to>

The list of peers can be specified using domain names (www.myNode.com) 
or IP addresses. Example:

peers=173.242.119.177, 176.9.42.247, 217.79.19.226, 98.216.173.54

(The older property singleNodeConnection is still honoured but is
now deprecated. Use 'peers' instead).

Note: ONLY these peers will be used for connections.


Testnet
-------
To use the testnet set the property "testOrProductionNetwork" 
to be "test".

To use the testnet3 set the property "testOrProductionNetwork" 
to be "testnet3".
