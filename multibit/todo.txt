TODO for minimal viable product
--------------------------------
check sending and receiving works reliably
add in support for fees
make sure right icons are used - no coffee cups
test it works on the test network
check switching of wallets hooks up all listeners correctly
ensure switch from test to prod does not confuse which wallet is open. (last test/prod wallet setting ?)

Documentation
-------------
write release notes / install guide
get the online help to point to basic HTML help

Logging and errors
------------------
no error message in MultiBitService#sendCoins when not enough money
no error message when cannot connect to peer
client does not go offline if you disconnect from network
no logging - use log4j

Future enhancements
-------------------
internationalise to Russion
add in proper jar bundling to exe and DMG - look at ProGuard
improve UI - address can be on main screen rather than a key click away
add in wallet encryption
support for subscriptions/ standing orders
