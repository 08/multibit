TODO for minimal viable product
--------------------------------
check sending and receiving works reliably
add in support for fees
make sure right icons are used - no coffee cups
test it works on the test network
get rid of hardwired peer address - MultiBitService#MultiBitService - use DNSDiscovery on prod, IRCDiscovery on test
check switching of wallets hooks up all listeners correctly

Documentation
-------------
write release notes / install guide
get the online help to point to basic HTML help

Logging and errors
------------------
no error message in MultiBitService#sendCoins when not enough money
no error message when cannot connect to peer
client does not go offline if you disconnect from network
no logging - use log4j

Future enhancements
-------------------
internationalise to Russion
add in proper jar bundling to exe and DMG - look at ProGuard
improve UI - address can be on main screen rather than a key click away
add in wallet encryption

Bugs
----
Copy address on receive blanks label (copy address needs to get form data and store it). From Mike Hearn, 5 Aug 2011.
