Needs fixing prior to general release.

  Will have more feedback on "Send" confirm message box, including send successful/ fail, cannot spend unconfimed, change still waiting, any errors.

Fees

  Have added test for negative fee.   
  Have added test for fee less than minimum.
  Have set default to 0.0005.
  
UI 
+ Use of 3 sig figs in total misleading (Nibor).
  Have changed to show 4 sig figs i.e down to 100 mikes.(approx 0.1 USD cents).

Help

+ Network label stays at 'Offline' too long.  Show number of blocks.(Nibor)
  Will add in 'Connecting...' label.   Tooltip/message box/ panel with more network details including number of blocks.
+ Would be nice to drill down to transctions details/ look up in block explorer. (Nibor)
  Agreed.
+ Prioritise encryption. (Nibor).
  Agreed.
+ More flexibility with downloading block chain would be good. (Nibor).
  Agreed.
+ Would be good to have Windows installer. (Nibor).
  Agreed.   Plan to have installers for Win, Mac, Linux.
  

Logging and errors
------------------
+ client does not go offline if you disconnect from network
+ extend log4j logging to all important classes


Outstanding Bugs
----------------
+ if you close the 'open wallet' dialog with the window close button, then reopen it is tiny. (Now only happens sometimes).
+ if you have two multibit open on the same wallet addressbook and wallet can be overwritten one by the other.
  Will add open/ close times to info files and warn user.


Improvements
------------
+ add Swedish (Mats Henricson has volunteered)
+ test it works on the test network
+ ensure switch from test to prod does not confuse which wallet is open. (last test/prod wallet setting ?)
+ add wallet encryption
+ add in more test classes
+ add tests to check sending and receiving works reliably
+ Tidy up github - get rid of extra multibit directory
+ Add in proper jar bundling to exe and DMG - look at ProGuard.   See how Open-Transaction does it.


Patches to Mike
---------------
+ Provide patch with Wallet.java for fees
+ Provide patch with Peer, PeerGroup, Transaction, Transaction?input, Wallet, WalletEventListener for pending transactions
