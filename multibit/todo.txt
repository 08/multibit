TODO for minimal viable product
--------------------------------
add wallet encryption
add in support for fees
make sure right icons are used - no coffee cups including help
test it works on the test network
check switching of wallets hooks up all listeners correctly
ensure switch from test to prod does not confuse which wallet is open. (last test/prod wallet setting ?)

Logging and errors
------------------
o no error message in MultiBitService#sendCoins when not enough money
o no error message when cannot connect to peer
o client does not go offline if you disconnect from network
o extend log4j logging to all important classes

Outstanding Bugs
----------------
o if you close the 'open wallet' dialog with the window close button, then reopen it is tiny
o wallet listeners don't seem to work when you open another wallet

Improvements
------------
o add in more test classes
o add tests to check sending and receiving works reliably
o Tidy up github - get rid of extra multibit directory
o Add in proper jar bundling to exe and DMG - look at ProGuard
o Improve UI - address can be on main screen rather than a key click away - too many windows - Eclipse style ?
