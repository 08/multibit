MultiBit is a bitcoin desktop client powered by bitcoinj


Build Preparations.

You can build MultiBit straight from the github code 
however the user experience is improved if you include a
copy of the production blockchain.   This gets the user started
quicker.

The blockchain is the same format as created by bitcoinj but has to be
called 'multibit.blockchain' (production) or
'multibit-testnet.blockchain' (testnet) in the same dir as the
executable jar.


How to Build MultiBit

To build MultiBit, run the 'all' task in the build.xml.
The distributable is created in the 'dist' directory and is called:
"multibit-yyyymmdd.zip"
