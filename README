How to Build MultiBit

MultiBit now uses a Maven POM.XML.  
The important targets are:

maven clean package
Package the multibit classes into a multibit.jar


maven install
take the multibit.jar and create:
+ an executable jar = multibit-exe.jar
+ a Mac application bundle = MultiBit.app
+ a Mac DMG file = MultiBit.dmg
+ an installer for Windows = multibit-installer.exe
+ a generic installer (for Linux) = multibit-installer.jar


To run MultiBit from the distributable, follow the instructions at:

Testnet
-------
To use the testnet set the property "testOrProductionNetwork" in the file multibit.properties to be "test".


Connect to single node
----------------------
If you want to connect to a single node set the following property in multibit.properties:
singleConnectionNode=<node to connect to>

The node can be specified as either a domain name (www.myNode.com) or an IP address.
