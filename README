How to Build MultiBit

MultiBit now uses a Maven POM.XML.

Package the multibit classes into a multibit.jar


maven install
take the multibit.jar and create:
+ an executable jar = multibit-exe.jar
+ a Mac application bundle = MultiBit.app
+ a Mac DMG file = MultiBit.dmg
+ an installer for Windows = multibit-installer.exe
+ a generic installer (for Linux) = multibit-installer.jar
