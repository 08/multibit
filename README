Introduction
============

MultiBit is a lightweight Bitcoin desktop client powered by the BitCoinJ library. 

How to Build MultiBit
=====================

MultiBit use Maven as the build system, so the usual Maven processes apply. If you're not familiar 
with Maven then download it first from http://maven.apache.com and after verifying that it's working,
you're ready. 

Bitcoinj dependency
===================
MultiBit depends on a clone of bitcoinj for its Bitcoin support.
This clone is currently located at:
http://code.google.com/r/jimburton618-bitcoinj-coinbase-tx/source/browse

The branch used is:
bcj-master-mb-alice

You need to clone this repo and then build and install this version of bitcoinj into your local repo using:
mvn clean install


Maven build targets
===================
The important targets are:

mvn clean package

which will package the MultiBit project into multibit-x.y.jar where x.y is the current version
number. This is suitable for local development work.

If you want to generate a complete set of multi-platform installers (Windows, Mac and Linux) you 
use the following command

maven clean install

After some processing, you will have the folowing artifacts in the target directory:

+ an executable jar = multibit-exe.jar
+ a Mac application bundle = MultiBit-x.y.app
+ a Mac DMG file = multibit-x.y.dmg
+ an installer for Windows = multibit-x.y-windows.exe
+ an installer for Linux = multibit-x.y-linux.jar

To run MultiBit from these artifacts you can follow the instructions provided on the main MultiBit
website here: http://multibit.org/help.html 

Configuration parameters are described in the configuration.txt
